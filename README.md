A sweet 2D game made using sfml, a open source graphics library.

Ideas:

2d, lightweight, mobile online battle arena style game that features iconic people/things from history a heroes 2d, RPG with lots of referances to geeky stuff!

Care to play?

To compile on windows/mac, go and check out the sfml documentation, it only takes a few minutes to set up.

Mac OS X http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-osx.php

Windows http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-cb.php

For all of the poor unfortunate souls using linux... (including me...grumble)

cd (your preferred install location)

git clone https://github.com/BroManSalaam/TPC

compile using this command into the terminal (Fill in the necessary () fields beforehand)

g++-4.8 main.cpp Game.cpp Player.cpp EntityManager.cpp Enemy.cpp ImageManagement.cpp Entity.cpp InputManagement.cpp Projectile.cpp -o TheProgrammersCode -std=c++11 -pthread -I (path to sfml/include) -L (path to sfml/lib) -lsfml-network -lsfml-audio -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

execute using this

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=(path to sfml/lib) && ./TheProgrammersCode
